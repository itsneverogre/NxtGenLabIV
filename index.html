      <h2>Welcome to DPRK Supporters Anonymous!</h2>
      <p>We are the outspoken majority in the belly of the imperialist beast. We are based in the United States, but fully support the brave and courageous endeavors of Eternal President <strong>Kim Il-Sung</strong> and his liberation of the Fatherland from US imperialists and Japanese aggressors.</p>
      <p>We help to support and keep alive the legacy of the Juche ideology that was molded by Eternal President <strong>Kim Il-Sung</strong>, and kept by Dear Leader <strong>Kim Jong-Il</strong> and Marshal <strong>Kim Jong-Un</strong>. The US refuses to acknowledge the strength of the revolutionary ideal that liberated the Fatherland from the whim of their imperialistic reign.</p>
      <p>Every day, we continue to advocate and safeguard the sovereignty and future of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against US imperialists, Japanese agressors, and south Korean puppets. We are here to make sure the DPRK wins its fight to defend the revolutionary Juche ideology, which we truly reflect in our struggle.</p>
      <p>Join us in the fight now to tame the warmongering American beast. The time is now to protect the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against all enemies and adversaries. If another nation dare intrude the sovereign borders and territorial waters of the DPRK, even a hundredth of a millimeter, the revolutionary forces of the DPRK will ruthlessly push those invading forces back and will take all actions necessary to ensure the security of the DPRK.</p>
      <p>If the US imperialists dare attempt to aggravate the patience of the DPRK, the revolutionary forces of the Korean People's Army will ward them off, taking any measures possible to defend the great Juche ideology and the future of the Korean people. The socialist system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall never fall from the face of the Earth, and shall grow stronger with every passing day. With your support, we can guarantee a future for our great nation and for the revolutionary Juche ideology that has made the DPRK the strong economic power that it is.</p>
