      <h2 class="textcenter">About</h2>
      <p>DPRK Supporters Anonymous was founded on July 13, 2017 (Juche 106) in the United States. Our founder decided that people should be able to support the revolutionary government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while also avoiding persecution by the imperialist US government. Our founder felt that creating a community like this would allow these people to voice their support for the DPRK while also remaining completely anonymous. Hence, DPRK Supporters Anonymous was born.</p>
      <p>We follow the revolutionary Juche ideology that came into existence through the wise mind of Eternal President <strong>Kim Il-Sung</strong>, who liberated the Fatherland from the whim of US imperialists and Japanese aggressors, and he would remain the primary defender of the Juche ideology until his tragic death in 1994 (Juche 83). Dear Leader <strong>Kim Jong-Il</strong> became the Leader of a great nation following his father's death until he himself tragically died in 2011 (Juche 100).</p>
      <p>Since then, the DPRK has been led under the warm and knowledgeable guidance of Marshal <strong>Kim Jong-Un</strong>, keeping his grandfather's revolutionary Juche ideology alive and well. Today, the DPRK is at the forefront of the technological race, leading the world in all technological metrics. The DPRK is always creating new and innovative indigenous technologies, which helps the DPRK prosper and grow stronger by the day.</p>
      <p>The Korean people will fight in defense of the revolutionary Juche ideology until the future of the DPRK is safeguarded, and we have made it our mission to assist and advance the noble intentions of the DPRK. We will help them make large strides forward in the technological race to reinforce the greatness of Eternal President <strong>Kim Il-Sung</strong> and Dear Leader <strong>Kim Jong-Il</strong> through the revolutionary Juche ideology and the unparalleled strength of the Korean People's Army.</p>
      <p>The US stands no chance against a united Korean people, and it is best for them to not aggravate the attention of the DPRK and its peaceful yet resilient citizens. We will not lose the fight to US imperialists. We will emerge triumphant! We will retain the life of the revolutionary Juche ideology! The Sun of Korea shall always rise over the Korean people, pushing us forward through the technological race under the guidance of the revolutionary Juche ideology at the speed of a supersonic jet!</p>
